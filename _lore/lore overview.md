world of fantasia:

the idea of stolen land:

kingdom of sapienza, founded on land taken from the original denisovans

post apocalyptic

- the first age is primeval, hunter gatherer age.
- the second age is 5,000 years of civilization building, with little to no magic. celestial gap is barely open, allowing certain powerful beings to emerge and influence the world.
- the second age closes with 200 years of the discovery of the mana bugs leading to their exploitation as the most valuable resource, and finally with the opening of the celestial gap from which all magical beings originally came.
- the third age begins with calamity. an era of absolute apocalypse, with magical beings and demons running amok. considered the 'age of heroes' in future retellings
- the fourth age is the rebuilding of the world and the dawn of the star empire. immortal beings from the age of heroes pull all the strings. the closing of the celestial gap
- the fifth age is the age of the star empire. magic and magical beings are at a minimum and essentially under control of the star emperor.

FANTASIA

A world actualizing itself

Abstract:

I was inspired to create the Fantasia by combining different elements of things I have obsessed over for most of my life. The primary driver was the history of the three Abrahamic faiths, which manifest so differently today than when they were born. The secondary driver was Dark Souls, and more broadly the ‘interactive art’ game. The third driver was an appreciation for the breadth of human ingenuity.

  

This is a world that begins in a prehistoric age and succeeds well into the future of our present time. There is one single story from 10,000BC to 10,000AD, and it’s the story of mankind’s evolution. That story begins with a messianic act, a segregated society, and ends with humans developing a utopian civilization (sort of). The idea is - an act from thousands of years ago has repercussions, ripples, and effects that last generations and drive the world-spirit. The fulfillment of this act - the so-called Star Empire (far future) - is, to my best ability, a representation of a ‘perfect’ society that has complex flaws. We will always be flawed, and our man-made structures are just different attempts to restrain those flaws. That is the story of Fantasia.

1.  Prehistoric Age
    

The world is dead, and time is still...

-The very first ‘scene’ of Fantasia is the journey of a man to the World’s End for the purpose of reviving his dead lover, where after passing through a dense, ancient forest, he arrives at the Moon Pond and meets a sage-like being named Fate. This being, who is eternally present for all of the history of Fantasia, doesn’t speak or move. He sits like a dead Buddhist priest by this small pond and wears a mask carved from the Ancient Ashen Trees. 

-This story is mythical. The version told here is the popular mythos that spans the rest of the timeline, but there are some intricacies that can be played with as to the ‘real truth’.

-The man, an Adam or Enki-like character , is made to sacrifice something into the pond. In my original draft of the story, he cuts off his right hand, so for now let’s go with that. 

 -This act, symbolizing in this world Man’s sacrifice, brings his lover back to life and they leave the World’s End together. The popular mythos says that this act elevated all of Adam-like’s descendants, basically turning Homo Erectus to Homo Sapien. 

-In our world, there are two types of humans (at least, this is what is thought by society) - you can think of them as Homo Sapiens and something more primitive, like a Homo Erectus - typically larger, more brutish, hairy, darker skin, etc. 

-Thus, from an early time, the world is divided amongst an elite class of slender, bred, high pedigree Sapiens and a slave class of non-Sapiens. Over time, a caste system develops between the two and any interbreeding. For a long time until the Star Empire, the Sapiens - think elves or high-bred European elite, but with slightly sino-asiatic features, think Annunaki - make up the feudal or monarchial class. All in-between classes - merchants, soldiers, academics, scientists, alchemists, etc - are some level of mixed-blood. 

-Of course the reality is that there was never a difference in the two species and there has always been only one type of human. This divide is a core conflict that is resolved over our history.

  
  
  

2.  Agricultural Age
    

-This age is defined by the conflict of Sapiens and Non-Sapiens, as a wealthy class of Sapiens begins to subjugate Non-Sapiens via force as well as the ideology that they are naturally inferior. 

-We begin to see the birth of the Satric Religion, based on the sacrifice of the right hand. This pagan religion elevates Mankind’s sacrifice as reason for his dominion over land and earth, and actively oppresses Non-Sapiens as part of its ideology. 

-As the early forms of a Satric Society begin to take shape (our first metropolis), many brave Non-Sapien figures arise during this time, including heads of slave revolts and miracle-workers. Many of these become Non-Sapien folk heroes.

-Non-Sapiens also form their own societies, but are often forced into slavery by larger tribes or devastated entirely. However, some will continue to survive for some time, developing their own cultures and norms.

-This era is one of the longest in our history, I would say it lasts almost 8,000 years or so. We can liken this age to Pre-Temple Judea or the time of the Judges. Early societies, akin to Mesopotamia and Carthage and Indus Valley etc, are beginning to form. Populations for different cities and tribes number less than 10,000 but begin to explode near the end of the age as farming practices are mastered and tribes begin to settle down.

-We also see the formation of Itinerant religious practice, i.e. wandering preachers, holy men, nomadic sages, etc.

  

3.  Tribal Empires
    

-The era that begins to define the shape of our world societally.

-The great ‘Capital City’ Sapienza is founded in the South as a theocratic monarchy, led by the Satria and underpinned by Cardinals. The structure follows that of a hand - 4 fingers and 1 thumb. They take it very seriously.

-Tenets of Satric Practice: The Divine Hand is composed of five elements:

-Divinity is on Earth

-Divinity can be attained

-Mankind embodies divinity

-To deliver divinity upon others is the ultimate purpose/path of life

-There is no division but those who are on the path and those who aren’t (obviously hypocritical)

  

-Most other tribes pledge allegiance and follow the code. One great Northwestern tribe remains allied for most of our history.

-Itinerant preachers begin to form monotheistic natural religions in small areas, typically surrounded by nature - forest cults, lake people, marsh burial tribes, mountain people, etc.

-At the end of this era (I think), the MANA BUG  is discovered - working title. 

-Mana Bugs are little blue crystalline grubs that don’t move much and are found at the base of Ancient Ashen Trees. They appear to grow fat and sluggish underneath the soil at these trees’ roots. At some point in this era, these bugs are discovered to possess great magical power akin to electricity. The rest of our history will be defined by these bugs as a resource similar to oil or nuclear power.

  
  
  
  

4.  Holy Wars
    

-After thousands of years of human sacrifice and warping of original practices, in this era we see a vast reformation and a terrifying invasion. 

-A fleshed out world with different factions and power struggles. Dispersion of technology and inequalities of knowledge. {Rashidun Caliphate} 

5.  Discovery Era (Mercantilism)
    

-The era of shipping and transport. Defined by industrial aggregation within the landmass, groups of workers and the beginnings of the corporation

-Cooperation after 100 years of war from the previous era.

-Sharing of technologies and innovations, more industrial economies. The exploitation of mana crystal reserves is a prominent theme in this era, leading to overconsumption and starvation.

  

6.  The New Covenant
    

-The previous religions of the world are completely reinvented in this era. The reintroduction of Fate. This ‘new covenant’ results in the sterilization of all pure Non-Sapiens, causing their kind to slowly die out over the next hundred years. A short era defined by a few key moments and agreements to cement the world power structure. The ‘truth’ is revealed about Sapiens and Non-Sapiens.

-Further results of this covenant are the reduction of magical abilities in the world. All mana crystals begin to die and have a half-life, and magic begins to leave the world.

  

7.  World Revolutions
    

-Turbulent time period as magic begins to leave the world. The last stand of the Non-Sapiens and their mixed counterparts. Some will hold power in the northern kingdoms and maintain the old world religions.  

-Sapienza is colonized from the East, city begins to decline through war after war. 

8.  Industrial Meritocracy/Closing of the Celestial Gap
    

-The beginnings of a global economy and empire. Wealth begins to accrue exponentially among a select few. Oligarchical struggles in every major city. The last remaining supplies of mana crystals are the most valuable resources on Earth.

-The average citizen becomes wealthy, beginnings of capitalism.

-Our ‘cyberpunk’ age - last remnants of nature and old-world beliefs. People begin moving to the cities for work and the structure of society changes. Lasts 500 years. Entire bloodlines and dynasties born from this age that will last the next 10,000 years.

  

9.  Dawn of The Star Empire
