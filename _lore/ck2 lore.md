One of my favorite games is a history simulator called Crusader Kings 2, it begins in 769AD and runs until 1440 (if you play that long). You make choices, but the game is more about thousands of dice rolls happening every second and outcomes being generated, stories being written emergently, etc. There’s no win or lose, because it’s all just forward in the story. It’s a bit hard to explain but it’s very engaging, especially for history nerds.

  

I played one single campaign of CK2 for five years of real life (sometimes I still feel like going back…) and about 400 years of in-game history. Probably played for like 200+ hours. 

  

One of the cool but undercooked features of that game was a ‘chronicle’ that would record events and things as they happened. Unfortunately, it doesn’t record nearly enough interesting events and also puts in a lot of filler for no reason. It’s not great, not even good tbh. >>side project proposal: mod a better chronicle for ck2... Id fucken dieeee lmao<<

  

However the history of this campaign is totally etched into my mind and I can remember all the incredible little details about it. There are some gems in the chronicle too, if you can parse through the bs.

So I’m going to keep the text of the chronicle here for my own reference, this sh*t is better than game of thrones lmao. Lots of good stories that span generations and could serve as great inspiration for our own stories. You’ve got interfamilial killing, great crusades, wars that last 100 years, romance and affairs, assassinations and diplomacy, you name it.

  

And yes at the risk of epic cringe i play as my own name and made it my own little roleplaying world i swear this game has been my therapy sometimes
