A gathering in the town square.
Gather around! Gather around!
What's going on here? 
Old man's off his head, seems.
Says he's seen something in the woods, I hear.
Heard he ran back in a fright before the sun's rise.
Knocking on doors..!
Screaming deathcries and scallopsongs..!
His hand's gone, do you see that? Stumped! [change]
Wasn't it always that way?

I saw the beast. I went, under the full moon like a fool, tempting the fates. Seeking herbs for my granddaughter, as you all know the girl is frail. The herba can only be plucked on a full moon night, isn't that so? I went, with only basket and dagger headed for the Marbush. After the fringes, I came upon a clearing. Least I thought it was! Suddenly there was a lake there I'd never seen before! And I can tell you if we go back there now it'll be gone, but by the tides I swear I nearly fell in it!

Say friend, what's that gathering over there?
The old man's telling a story. Does this every now and again. 
I see. 
Where you from?
Just passing through. 
That's a nice set of steel you got there. 
I'm not looking to sell. 
I've got oils, pressed here in my shop. Tgemvale, orchite, stabilized.. valuable for one such as yourself.
I am not looking to sell.
Well, if you come around..

There was a knight?
Yes, as my grandfather was speaking, a knight had just arrived in town. A traveling bannersman.
Where from?
Catarin, I think. He did not say openly.
