play as a 2.5d space as a 'digger' between worlds

wander around a beautiful map and at any time, 'dig' into the ground and emerge onto a completely new map

like LSD dream emulator, you are entering a 'new place' every time you dig

could have certain objectives appear per map, many maps having no objective
