putting you in the shoes of a lowly soldier climbing throught the ranks of an army. you are one of dozens of soldiers, forced to prove yourself to have a name, with one goal in mind - become the great general of the army and unify the 3 kingdoms. 

you could start as a lowly soldier with your best friend and end up fighting him as two opposite generals in the final clash.

turn based, with each turn consisting of either a rest phase spending AP for activities or a battle.

battles are automatic, with the actions of dozens of participants procedurally generated and displayed - drama, tension and spontaneity are key.

drama would be generated through several layers of traits and outcomes:

ex. Joe swings *right hand* at Bob
		<joe>'righthand' = bruised from previous fight
		<joe>'drunk'
		<joe>str= 8 
		<bob>str = 12
		*dice roll*
			Bob breaks Joe's right hand

With every character accounted for as an object with dozens of key value pairs, interactions can be hard coded as dice rolls and variable checks. Interactions will have inputs and outputs, adding traits or making changes to the characters involved. 
			
Players will have a limited but competent palette of choices to make to further themselves in the world and set themselves above their peers. Characters from the beginning of a players journey will rise and fall, achieve heights or vanish into obscurity or meet death in the campaign, leading to dozens of interactions with new characters at each rank. 
			
The game will generate probabilities, actions, and events through layers of abstractions like so:
			
(abstract) - - - - - > - - -  - - - - > - - - - - - - - > - - - - - - - - - - - >(concrete)
	world > locations > traditions > cultures > factions > relations/opinion > objects
			
by making *certain elements of the world* static, we can generate more focused story elements
			
instead of creating many infinite situations and outcomes, we should focus on making traits and world elements matter with relation to the limited player choices ie. give players ways to strategize their movements using their limited tools at hand
			
An important element of this game will be the hierarchy of the military as well as the social hierarchy - I imagine for each kingdom, there will be one tree of each composed of 10-12 characters each - thus, each kingdom will constantly have a cast of 20 or so characters to keep track of. Progressing up the hierarchy will be the main goal of the player.
